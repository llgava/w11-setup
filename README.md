# Windows 11 Setup
This is a personal setup for my Windows 11 environment. Is not complete and I'm not sure when will be.
Probably this will be constantly updated everytime I format my PC. 

### Running without Debloat
```pwsh
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llgava/w11-setup/refs/heads/main/install.ps1" | iex
```

### Passing `-withDebloat` argument.
```pwsh
irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llgava/w11-setup/refs/heads/main/install.ps1" -withDebloat | iex
```
